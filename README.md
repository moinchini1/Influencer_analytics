# Influencer_analytics 
This is a one of the project I worked during virtual Internship at KultureHire. The task was to analyse social media presence for last one year for any selected influencer. I chose Alex Frieberg and analysed data for last one year for his Linkedin & you tube accounts. This projects highlightes his online presence on several parameters using dashboard & final report documents it in detail
I have used my skills of identying problem statement, planning data sources, data collection, cleaning, analysing, visualising & repoting using tools such as excel, power BI, powerpoint & word
